# The mapping from image coordinates to feature map coordinates might cause
# some boxes that are distinct in image space to become identical in feature
# coordinates. If DEDUP_BOXES > 0, then DEDUP_BOXES is used as the scale factor
# for identifying duplicate boxes.
# 1/16 is correct for {Alex,Caffe}Net, VGG_CNN_M_1024, and VGG16
